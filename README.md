<!-- # create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production. -->

## 🧐 About

Important but basic info

## Install

### Package Manager

#### NPM <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
npm i package_name
```

#### PNPM <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
pnpm add package_name
```

#### Yarn <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
yarn add package_name
```

### CDN

#### Skypack <!-- omit in TOC -->

For Web and Deno, no install is required! Just put this line at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { inflate } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/package_name';
```

If you want type support with skypack, follow the directions [here]('https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/code/javascript#using-skypack-urls-in-typescript')

#### UNPKG <!-- omit in TOC -->

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/package_name"></script>
```

And use it like you would any other package from UNPKG

## 🔧 Running the tests

The basic set of tests are in the test script, the coverage script, and the report script. Just run those using your perferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) to make sure nothing has broken.

## 🎈 Usage

Here's the great part: thanks to [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle), this package supports CJS, UMD, and ESM formats.
That means that wherever and however you use this package — in browser or node, with import or require — you _should_ be set, no configuration required.
